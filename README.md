# Code Refactor Starter Code
The first step in the process was to organize the code to follow the structure of HTML elements.
After doing so, I reflected the changes to CSS Style shheet so it would run properly
I viewed the image elements and noticed there was not a defined ALT element so I added it
I aligned the heading attributes to reflect sequential order.
The title element was tweeked but overall stayed the same.
